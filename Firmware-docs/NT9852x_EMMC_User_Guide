Of course. This is a complex technical document, but I will break it down for you step-by-step, assuming no prior knowledge. Think of this as a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with the Novatek NT9852X chip when it's configured to start up (boot) from an EMMC storage chip.

### **High-Level Summary: What is this document about?**

This document is a **user guide** for engineers. It explains how to configure, update, and boot a system using a Novatek NT9852X processor where the main operating system is stored on an **eMMC** chip (a common, soldered-on storage chip, like the SSD in your computer but smaller).

The key concepts it covers are:
1.  **How to structure the eMMC's memory** into different sections (partitions) for the bootloader, operating system, and user data.
2.  **How to create the system software images** that will be written to those partitions.
3.  **Multiple methods to update** the software on the eMMC, both from a development PC and in a finished product.
4.  **The step-by-step process the chip follows** to start up from the eMMC.

### **Core Concept: What is eMMC?**

*   **eMMC** (embedded MultiMediaCard) is a package containing flash memory and a memory controller. It's a common, cost-effective storage solution for embedded devices (like cameras, IoT devices, set-top boxes).
*   It is physically soldered onto the board, unlike an SD card which is removable.
*   It can be divided into **physical partitions**:
    *   **Boot Partitions (x2):** Small, dedicated areas for the very first piece of code that runs (the "loader"). Having two allows for a backup (if an update to boot partition #0 fails, it can boot from #1).
    *   **RPMB Partition:** A secure, authenticated partition for storing sensitive data (not covered in detail here).
    *   **User Partition:** The main storage area. This is where the operating system (Linux), your applications, and data are stored. **This user partition is itself divided into logical partitions** (like having a C: drive and D: drive on Windows).

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of the PDF**

#### **1. Features (Page 4)**
This section lists what the system can do. The most important features are:
*   Booting the entire system from eMMC.
*   Providing tools to create the complex partition layout on the eMMC.
*   A recovery mechanism if a software update fails and the system won't start.

#### **2. System Configuration (Pages 5-21)**
This is the most critical section for setup. It tells you which files to modify to define your system's layout.

*   **2.1 Configs & 2.2 Compilation:** The software development kit (SDK) provides pre-made configuration files for different setups.
    *   `cfg_EMMC_EVB`: For a system using a full **EXT4** filesystem (like a Linux desktop).
    *   `cfg_EMMC_RAMDISK_EVB`: For a system using a smaller **RAMDISK** (the filesystem is loaded into fast RAM at boot).
    *   You choose one of these configs and then run `make all` to build the entire system.

*   **2.3 nvt-na51055-peri.dtsi:** This file defines hardware peripherals. It's set up to tell the system that the eMMC chip is connected to the `SDIO3` hardware interface. **You usually don't need to change this.**

*   **2.4 nvt-na51055-storage-partition.dtsi:** **THIS IS A KEY FILE.** This is where you define the layout of the **User Partition**. It's like drawing a map of the eMMC's memory, defining each section's name, start point, and size.
    *   **Example (from page 8):**
        ```dts
        partition_uboot { label = "uboot"; reg = <0x0 0x000C0000 0x0 0x00200000>; };
        ```
        *   `label = "uboot"`: The name of this partition is "uboot".
        *   `reg = <0x0 0x000C0000 0x0 0x00200000>`: This is the address and size. It starts at address `0xC0000` and is `0x200000` bytes (2 MB) long.
    *   The document explains three types of systems you can build:
        1.  **EXT4-based (Page 8):** The main `rootfs` is a large, persistent EXT4 partition where all applications and data live. This is the most common and flexible setup.
        2.  **RAMDISK-based (Page 13):** The main `rootfs` is a small, compressed image loaded into RAM. You *must* have other partitions (like `rootfs1`) mounted later for storing user data and applications. This is good for systems with limited storage but sufficient RAM.
        3.  **SQUASHFS-based (Page 15):** Similar to RAMDISK, the `rootfs` is a compressed, read-only filesystem. You need other read-write partitions for data.

*   **2.5 nvt-na51055-nvtpack.dtsi:** **ANOTHER KEY FILE.** This file creates a recipe for building an "all-in-one" firmware image. It maps the partition names from the `storage-partition.dtsi` file to the actual file names of the images you built.
    *   **Example (from page 17):**
        ```dts
        id3 { partition_name = "uboot"; source_file = "u-boot.bin"; };
        id6 { partition_name = "rootfs"; source_file = "rootfs.ext4.bin"; };
        ```
        *   This tells the packer: "For the partition named `uboot`, use the file `u-boot.bin`. For the partition named `rootfs`, use the file `rootfs.ext4.bin`."

*   **2.6 nvt-na51055-info.dtsi:** This file sets a few global variables. The most important one is `NVT_ROOTFS_TYPE`, which must match the system you are building (e.g., `NVT_ROOTFS_TYPE_EXT4`).

#### **3. Update and Recovery (Pages 22-32)**
This section explains how to get your software onto the eMMC chip.

*   **3.1 / 3.2: All-in-One Image Update:** The simplest method. You create a single file (`FW(SOC)A.bin`) that contains *everything*. You put this file and a loader file (`LD(SOC)A.bin`) on an SD card, insert it into the device, and turn it on. The boot process automatically detects the SD card and updates the eMMC. **This is likely the method you will use first.**

*   **3.3: Raw Image Update in U-Boot:** A more advanced method. You break the "all-in-one" image into its individual parts (`u-boot.bin`, `uImage.bin`, etc.). You then use U-Boot commands (a pre-OS environment) to load each file (e.g., from a network via TFTP) and write it to its specific partition on the eMMC.
    *   **Example Command (Page 25):**
        ```bash
        nvt@na51055: tftp 0x20000 u-boot.bin     # Load file from network into memory at address 0x20000
        nvt@na51055: mmc write 0x20000 0x600 0x400 # Write from memory to eMMC starting at block 0x600, writing 0x400 blocks
        ```

*   **3.4 / 3.5: Update from Linux Shell:** Once Linux is running on the target, you can update individual partitions.
    *   For **raw** partitions (like the kernel), you can simply use `cat uImage.bin > /dev/mmcblk2p27`.
    *   For **EXT4** partitions (like your app data), you use the `simg2img` tool to write a pre-formatted filesystem image directly to the partition, which is much faster and more reliable.

*   **3.6: Update Loader:** Shows the Linux command to write a new loader binary to the protected boot partition of the eMMC.

#### **4. Boot Flow (Pages 33-34)**
This describes the sequence of events when you power on the chip.
1.  **Hardware:** The chip loads the first stage **Loader** from the eMMC **boot partition**.
2.  **Loader:** The loader initializes basic hardware and loads the second stage bootloader, **U-Boot**, from the *user partition*.
3.  **U-Boot:** U-Boot initializes more hardware (like DRAM, network), reads its environment variables, **loads the Linux kernel (`uImage`)** and **Device Tree (`.dtb`)** into memory, and then starts the kernel.
4.  **Linux:** The kernel takes over, initializes all drivers, and **mounts the root filesystem** (e.g., the `rootfs` EXT4 partition) as its main directory. It then starts the main system process (`init`), which launches all your applications.

#### **5. Partition without MBR (Pages 35-36)**
An advanced topic. It describes an alternative partitioning scheme that doesn't use a Master Boot Record (MBR), which is the standard way to define partitions on a PC. This is more common in embedded systems. It requires changes to the device tree and the loader configuration.

#### **6. Limitations (Page 37)**
Important constraints to be aware of:
*   The "all-in-one" image must be smaller than the temporary memory area reserved for it in the device tree.
*   Updating via USB or Ethernet is not fully tested.
*   The bootloader doesn't support the absolute fastest speeds the eMMC chip is capable of.

### **How to Get Started: A Practical Example**

**Goal: Build and flash an EXT4-based system.**

1.  **Set up Environment:** You have the Novatek SDK downloaded and your build environment ready.
2.  **Choose Config:** In the SDK, you navigate to the configs and select `cfg_EMMC_EVB`.
3.  **Modify Partitions (Optional):** You open `nvt-na51055-storage-partition.dtsi`. You see the `rootfs` partition is `0x0A000000` bytes (~160 MB). If your application needs 200 MB, you change this size to `0x0C800000` and adjust the start addresses of the partitions that follow it.
4.  **Build:** You run `make all`. The build system:
    *   Compiles U-Boot, the Linux kernel, and your applications.
    *   Creates an EXT4 filesystem image for the `rootfs` partition.
    *   Uses `nvt-na51055-nvtpack.dtsi` to pack all the individual images into `FW(SOC)A.bin`.
5.  **Flash:**
    *   You copy `LD(SOC)A.bin` and `FW(SOC)A.bin` to an SD card.
    *   You insert the SD card into your Novatek evaluation board.
    *   You power
