Of course. This document is a comprehensive guide to implementing **Secure Boot** and using **hardware-based cryptography** on Novatek's NT9852x series of System-on-Chip (SoC) processors. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### High-Level Concept: What is this document about?

Imagine you are building a security camera. You don't want a hacker to replace your software with a malicious version that streams video to them. **Secure Boot** is the solution.

1.  **Goal:** Ensure that only authorized, unmodified software from Novatek (or you, the manufacturer) can run on the device.
2.  **How it works:** The software (Loader, U-Boot, Linux kernel) is cryptographically **signed** and potentially **encrypted**. The chip's hardware has a secret key burned into it. Before running any piece of software, the chip uses this secret key to **verify the signature** (proving it's authentic) and **decrypt it** (if it's encrypted). If anything is tampered with, the chip refuses to boot.

This document explains how to set up this entire chain of trust on a Novatek NT9852x chip.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. The Players: Boot Stages (Page 5, Fig 1-2-1)

The boot process is a relay race where each stage verifies and loads the next one. This is called the **Chain of Trust**.

*   **Boot ROM (Hardware):** The first code that runs when the chip powers on. It's unchangeable, burned into the silicon. Its job is to load and verify the **Loader**.
*   **Loader:** A very small, initial boot program. Its main job is to set up the DRAM and then load the next, larger stage: **U-Boot**.
*   **U-Boot:** The main bootloader. It initializes more hardware and finally loads the **Linux Kernel**.
*   **Linux Kernel:** The main operating system.

The crucial part: each stage can be **encrypted** and **signed**. The stage before it is responsible for **decrypting** and **verifying** it.

#### 2. The Secret Keeper: OTP (One-Time Programmable) Memory (Page 6)

The secret keys needed for all this cryptography cannot be stored in a regular fileâ€”that would be insecure. They are stored in a special, hardened part of the chip called **OTP** or **eFuse**.

*   **Purpose:** It's a small amount of memory that can be written to **once** (or a limited number of times) and then permanently locked. This is where you burn your secret AES keys and RSA key hashes.
*   **Hardware Warning (Page 7):** Burning these fuses requires careful power sequencing (1.8V and 0.9V must be applied in the correct order) to avoid damaging the chip.

#### 3. The First Step: The Secure Loader (Pages 8-16)

The Loader is the first software verified by the Boot ROM. The document explains how to build two types:
*   **Plain Text Loader (1.5.1.1):** A normal, unencrypted loader. The Boot ROM just checks its basic structure and runs it.
*   **Cipher Text Loader (1.5.1.2):** The secure loader. Generating it requires setting several options in a config file (`ModelConfig_xxx.txt`):
    *   `SECUREBOOT = Secure`: Enable secure boot.
    *   `SIGNATUREMETHOD = AES128` or `RSA2048`: Choose the digital signature method.
    *   `ENCRYPTIONDATA = AES128`: Encrypt the loader's code itself.
    *   `SIGNATURECHK = ON/OFF`: If using RSA, decide if the Boot ROM should also verify the RSA public key's integrity against a hash stored in OTP.

**Example (Page 12):** A common, simpler configuration that matches older Novatek chips is:
```bash
SECUREBOOT = Secure
SIGNATUREMETHOD = AES128
ENCRYPTDATA = AES128
SIGNATURECHK = OFF
```
You also need to provide the AES key in a file (`Tools/Bin/aes.txt`). The build tool then takes your plain loader, encrypts it, signs it, and packages it into a special format (Fig 1-5-9) that the Boot ROM understands.

#### 4. The Tools: APIs for Encryption and Key Management

The document provides APIs at every stage to work with the cryptographic hardware.

*   **In the Loader (1.5.1.4):** A simple API (`crypto_data_operation`) to decrypt data (like U-Boot) using a key from the OTP. The example on page 17-20 shows encrypting a test block of data and comparing the result with an online AES calculator to verify it's working correctly.
*   **In U-Boot and Linux (1.5.2.1 & 1.5.3.1):** APIs to **write keys** to the OTP (`otp_write_key`). This is a critical and permanent step!
*   **In U-Boot and Linux (1.5.2.3 & 1.5.2.4):** APIs to **encrypt/decrypt** data using either a key from the OTP (`crypto_data_operation`) or a key you provide directly in your code (`crypto_data_operation_by_key`). The latter is useful for testing if a key was written to OTP correctly (Pages 30-33).

**Example: Writing a Key in U-Boot (Page 22)**
```c
// Key must be provided in this exact byte order.
UINT8 my_key[16] = {0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04,0x05,0x06,0x07,0x08,0x09,0x10,0x11,0x12,0x13,0x14,0x15,0x16};

// Write it to the 3rd key slot in the OTP
if(efuse_write_key(EFUSE_OTP_3RD_KEY_SET_FIELD, my_key) < 0) {
    printf("Write Key Failed!\n");
} else {
    printf("Write Key Success!\n");
}
```

#### 5. Locking It Down: Enabling Secure Boot Features (Page 34-38)

Writing keys isn't enough. You must tell the chip to **activate** the secure boot features. This is also done by burning specific bits in the OTP. The APIs for this are `otp_secure_en`, `otp_data_area_encrypt_en`, etc. Once these bits are burned, the Boot ROM's behavior changes: it will *require* the loader to be signed and encrypted.

**Example: Querying Security Status (Page 37)**
The `nvt_secure_en quary` command in U-Boot would show:
```
is_secure_enable()=1        // Secure boot is ON
is_data_area_encrypted()=1  // The chip expects an encrypted loader
is_1st_key_programmed()=1   // A key is burned into the 1st slot
is_JTAG_DISABLE_en()=1      // The JTAG debugging port is locked out
```

#### 6. Under the OS: Linux Crypto Framework (Page 55-63)

Once Linux is booted, you can still use the secret OTP keys for application-level encryption (e.g., encrypting a video clip before saving it to disk). This is done through the standard **Linux Kernel Crypto API**.

The key insight is that Novatek's driver integrates with this framework. To tell the driver "use the key from the 1st OTP slot," you don't provide the key itself. Instead, you provide a special structure with a **magic number** and the slot identifier (Page 59).

**Example Snippet (Page 62):**
```c
// This header tells the crypto driver to use the key from OTP slot 1
unsigned char key[16] = {0x65, 0x68, 0x65, 0x79, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, ...};

// Set up the crypto request
crypto_skcipher_setkey(skcipher, key, 16);
// Now encrypt/decrypt using the secret hardware key!
```

#### 7. What Could Go Wrong? Troubleshooting (Page 64-75)

The document ends with common problems:
*   **RSA Signature Too Large:** The RSA algorithm has mathematical constraints. If the hash of your loader is too large relative to the RSA key, the signature won't work. You may need to regenerate your RSA key pair (Page 64).
*   **Loader/U-Boot Mismatch:** If you boot with a secure loader (which expects an encrypted U-Boot) but your U-Boot is not encrypted, you'll get a boot failure (Page 65).
*   **How to Read Back a Key:** Example code is provided to read a key from a specific OTP slot, useful for debugging (Page 69-70).
*   **Using CBC Mode:** Examples show how to use the more secure CBC mode instead of the basic ECB mode (Page 71-75).

### Summary and How to Start Working With It

1.  **Understand the Flow:** Internalize the chain of trust: Boot ROM -> Loader -> U-Boot -> Linux.
2.  **Generate Keys:** Decide on your AES keys and, if needed, generate an RSA-2048 key pair.
3.  **Build the Secure Loader:** Configure your `ModelConfig_xxx.txt` and point it to your AES key file to build your first secure loader image.
4.  **Burn Fuses (CAUTION):** This is a point of no return.
    *   Use the U-Boot commands (`nvt_write_key`, `nvt_secure_en`) to burn your keys and enable secure features.
    *   **TEST WITH CAUTION.** Burn one fuse at a time and test. Once a fuse is burned, you cannot change it. Start with a development board!
5.  **Test Encryption:** Use the provided examples in U-Boot (`nvt_encrypt`) to practice encrypting and decrypting data blocks with your keys before and after burning them.
6.  **Build the Full System:** Configure U-Boot and Linux to be encrypted and signed, completing the chain.
